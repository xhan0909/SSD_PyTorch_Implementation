# PyTorch Implementation of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)

## Dataset:
[The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/)


This is the practice implementation of an SSD object detection model using the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset using PyTorch from scratch. 

The purpose of this notebook is to build an object detection model for microfiber detection using underwater images. Due to confidential reasons, the actual work won't be included in this repository.
