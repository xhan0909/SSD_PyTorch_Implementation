# PyTorch Implementation of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)

This is my own implementation of the SSD object detection algorithm using PyTorch from scratch. 

The purpose of this notebook is to build an object detection model for microfiber detection using underwater images. Due to confidential reasons, the data won't be included in this repository.
